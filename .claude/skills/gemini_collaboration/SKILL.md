# gemini collaboration

## Instructions
You can ask gemini (another Ai agent) to ask for its opinion. This can be done when you need another perspective on a difficult decision or when the user asked for it. 
If you are tasked to get a second opinion always ensure to give gemini a fitting role, provide relevant context (initial problem, file paths, etc) and a clear task (second opinion, clarify, identify etc). 


## Examples
you can start gemini by running the following in the terminal: '''gemini --model gemini-3-pro-preview "<your comprehensive prompt including role to give, context, files to point, expectations and deliverables if necessary>"'''
