**Last updated:** 2026-03-05
**Snapshot basis:** current Charm UI implementation commits (`516186d`, `ac7a60e`, `642ad8d`) plus targeted test runs on 2026-03-05

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Commits | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|---------|-------|
| 0 | Init Wizard | **COMPLETE** | `8477338` | Go init wizard + bridge bootstrapping |
| 1 | Protocol Foundation & Streaming Chat | **COMPLETE** | `78f7df8`..`742c99c` | IPC bridge, streaming, startup hardening |
| 2 | Rendering & UX Polish | **COMPLETE** | `78f7df8`..`742c99c` | markdown render, loading/status polish |
| 3 | Protocol Handlers & Native Interactions | **COMPLETE** | `516186d` | forms/select/progress/confirm plumbing captured |
| 4 | Slash Wiring + Autocomplete Baseline | **COMPLETE** | `516186d` | Go-native slash handling + bridge dispatch |
| 4.2 | Parity Hardening | **COMPLETE** | `ac7a60e` | `/open`, `/restore`, `/config` direct switch, protocol-safe branches |
| 5 | Rich CLI Functional/Visual Parity Migration | **IN PROGRESS** | `ac7a60e`, `642ad8d` | history ring, completion scaffold, native `/exit` confirm flow |
| 6 | BioCharm Components | NOT STARTED | — | deferred until Phase 5 parity baseline is stable |
| 7 | Distribution & Cross-Platform | NOT STARTED | — | deferred |
| 8 | SSH & Cloud | FUTURE | — | deferred |

## Current Baseline (2026-03-05)

- Go command history ring is active with draft restore behavior (`lobster-tui/internal/chat/model.go`).
- Path completion protocol is active (`completion_request`/`completion_response`) for `/read`, `/open`, `/workspace load` (`lobster-tui/internal/chat/completions.go`, `lobster/cli_internal/go_tui_launcher.py`).
- `/exit` in Go mode now uses native confirm prompt with explicit cancel/quit outcomes (`lobster-tui/internal/chat/model.go`, `lobster-tui/internal/chat/model_test.go`).
- Priority slash regressions fixed in Python dispatch path: `/open`, `/restore`, `/config provider <name>`, `/config model <name>`, `/save` protocol-safe branch (`lobster/cli_internal/commands/heavy/slash_commands.py`).
- Command matrix maintained in `.planning/charm-ui/PARITY_MATRIX.md` (current snapshot: no `blocked` command rows).

## Validation Run (2026-03-05)

- `cd lobster-tui && go test ./...` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/cli/test_go_tui_launcher_completions.py tests/integration/test_go_tui_protocol_smoke.py tests/unit/cli/test_slash_commands_go_tui_regressions.py -q` passed.

## Remaining Work (Phase 5)

- Complete OutputAdapter migration for remaining direct Rich rendering branches.
- Complete visual parity pass for high-frequency command outputs.
- Expand protocol smoke to command-family parity flows.
- Add transcript/golden checks for stable output shape and regression detection.

## Known Gaps / Tech Debt

1. `cancel` protocol event is still placeholder in Python event loop (`go_tui_launcher.py`).
2. `_execute_command()` still contains direct Rich rendering branches that are not fully OutputAdapter-converted.
3. Current integration coverage is smoke-level, not full parity transcript coverage.
4. Long streaming stress scenarios are not yet exercised by automated tests.
5. Cross-platform packaging/CI remains deferred to later phase.
