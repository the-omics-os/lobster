!Sample_description = Renal biopsy was minced into small pieces and incubated in freshly prepared dissociation buffer containing 0.25% trypsin and 40U/ml DNase I. Dissociated cells were harvested every 10 min by filtering the cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer (pluriSelect) into 10% FBS buffer on ice. The residual biopsy tissue trapped on the cell strainer was dissociated once again with 1 mL dissociation buffer for 10 min, passed through cell strainer into the same FBS buffer from the first collection. We repeated this dissociation procedure three times until most of the tissue had been dissociated into single cells (total dissociation time was 30 min). Finally, cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min, resuspended in inDrop cell suspension buffer (9% Optiprep) and strained by a 40 µm cell mesh (pluriSelect) to further remove cell clumps and large fragments.
!Sample_description = InDrop was performed as previous described. In brief, cells were diluted into 60,000 cells/mL in 9% Optiprep buffer. Single cell encapsulation was carried out using an inDrop instrument and microfluidic chip manufactured by 1CellBio. In total, four tubes of cells with an estimate of 1,000 cells/tube were collected. Library preparation was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. We used low PCR cycles (8-9 cycles) to amplify the libraries from this sample. Libraries were sequenced by HiSeq 2500 and NextSeq with a sequencing depth of 50K reads/cell.
!Sample_data_processing = Pair-end reads were processed by a newly developed inDrop computational pipeline (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/dropEst). In brief, cell barcodes and UMIs from the library were extracted from read1 by the dropTag program and added to the names of the transcript reads, resulting in a new fastq file for read alignment. We used STAR (version 2.5.3a) to map the high quality reads to the human genome (GRCh38). Only reads that were uniquely mapped to the genome (~70% of the total reads) were used for UMIs counts. We next ran the dropEst program to estimate the accurate molecular counts, which generated a UMI count matrix for each gene in each cell.
