!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H2228, H1975, A549, H838 and HCC827 were retrieved from ATCC (https://www.atcc.org/) and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin.  The cells were grown independently at 37C  with 5% carbon dioxide until near 100% confluency.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The cells were counted using Chamber Slide and rounghly 2 million cells from each cell line were mixed and processed by 10X. Three CEL-seq2 plates were sorted for the same sample.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = following the standard 10X single cell RNA-seq document, using v2 chemistry.
!Sample_data_processing = Fastq files were generated using Cellranger. All R1 files were concatenated and all R2 files were concatenated for processing with scPipe.
!Sample_data_processing = Sample filtered gene count matrix was generated using scPipe with ENSEMBL GRCh38p10 gene annotation. With scPipe, we processed the 5000 most enriched cell barcodes, with comp=2 used for quality control to remove poor quality cells.
