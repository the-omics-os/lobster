I've retrieved comprehensive metadata for GSE164378. This is an important multimodal single-cell RNA-seq dataset from a landmark study published in Cell (2021, PubMed ID: 34062119).

## Key Highlights:

**Study Type:** CITE-seq analysis of human PBMCs measuring both RNA and 228 surface proteins simultaneously
- **Organism:** Human peripheral blood immune cells
- **Technology:** Illumina NovaSeq 6000
- **Samples:** 9 multimodal single-cell samples
- **Scale:** Hundreds of thousands of cells profiled

**Scientific Significance:** This dataset introduced the Weighted-Nearest Neighbor (WNN) analysis framework for integrating multimodal single-cell data and created a comprehensive reference atlas of the human circulating immune system.

**Data Availability:**
- Cell metadata and antibody information files are available
- Individual sample files can be downloaded
- Note: Raw sequencing data is in dbGaP due to patient privacy
