**Symptoms:**
- "Dataset not found" errors
- Download timeouts
- Corrupted downloads

**Solutions:**

#### Verify GEO Accession
```bash
🦞 You: "Search for GSE12345 in GEO database and verify it exists"
🦞 You: "Download GSE12345 with verbose output to see detailed progress"
```

#### Handle Network Issues
```bash
# Check internet connectivity
ping ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

# Use alternative download method
🦞 You: "Download GSE12345 using alternative mirror or cached version"

# Manual download and load
🦞 You: "Load local file that I downloaded manually from GEO"
```

#### Clear Cache and Retry
```bash
# Clear GEO cache
rm -rf .geo_cache/

# Retry download
🦞 You: "Download GSE12345 with fresh cache"
```

### Issue: File Format Not Recognized

**Symptoms:**
- "Unknown file format" errors
- Cannot parse file headers
- Encoding issues

**Solutions:**

#### Specify File Format Explicitly
```bash
🦞 You: "Load CSV file with genes as rows and samples as columns"
🦞 You: "Load TSV file with tab separators and first row as header"
🦞 You: "Load Excel file from sheet named 'RNAseq_data'"
```

#### Check File Encoding
```bash
# Check file encoding
file -i your_data.csv

# Convert if needed
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 your_data.csv > your_data_utf8.csv
```

#### Provide File Structure Information
```bash
🦞 You: "This is a count matrix with gene symbols in first column, sample IDs in header row"
🦞 You: "The file has metadata in the first 3 rows, data starts from row 4"
🦞 You: "File uses semicolon separators instead of commas"
```

### Issue: Large Files Won't Load

**Symptoms:**
- Memory errors during loading
- Loading process hangs
- "File too large" messages

**Solutions:**

#### Use Chunked Loading
```bash
🦞 You: "Load large file in chunks of 10000 rows to save memory"

## Publication Intelligence & Docling Issues

### Issue: Docling Not Installed

**Symptoms:**
- `ImportError: No module named 'docling'`
- "Docling parser unavailable, falling back to PyPDF2"
- Warning messages about missing Docling dependencies

**Causes:**
- Docling package not installed
- Version mismatch with required dependencies
- Optional dependencies missing (OCR, table extraction)

**Solutions:**

#### Install Docling Package
```bash
# Install Docling with all dependencies
pip install docling

# Verify installation
python -c "from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter; print('✓ Docling installed')"
```

#### Install Optional Features
```bash
# For enhanced table extraction
pip install "docling[table]"

# For OCR support (PDFs with scanned images)
pip install "docling[ocr]"

# Full installation with all features
pip install "docling[all]"
```

#### Verify Docling Functionality
```bash
🦞 You: "Test Docling installation by extracting methods from a sample paper"
🦞 You: "Extract methods from PMID:38448586 using Docling"
```

**Fallback Behavior:**
- System automatically falls back to PyPDF2 if Docling unavailable
- Extraction still works but with lower Methods section detection rate (~30% vs >90%)
- Tables and formulas won't be extracted with PyPDF2

### Issue: MemoryError During PDF Parsing

**Symptoms:**
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate memory for document parsing
RuntimeError: PDF parsing failed after 2 retries
```

**Causes:**
- Large PDF documents (>100 pages)
- Complex layouts with many images
- Insufficient system memory (<4GB available)
- Multiple concurrent parsing operations

**Solutions:**

#### Immediate Actions
```bash
# Clear memory before parsing
🦞 You: "Clear workspace cache to free memory"
python -c "import gc; gc.collect()"

# Parse one document at a time
🦞 You: "Extract methods from PMID:12345678"  # Sequential processing
# Wait for completion before starting next extraction
```

#### Optimize Memory Usage
```bash
# Docling automatically retries with garbage collection
# The retry logic handles MemoryError automatically
# Just wait for the automatic retry to complete

# For very large PDFs, use PyPDF2 fallback explicitly
🦞 You: "Extract methods using PyPDF2 fallback for memory efficiency"
```

#### Monitor Memory
```bash
# Check available memory
free -h  # Linux
vm_stat  # macOS

# Monitor during extraction
🦞 You: "/dashboard"  # Check memory usage in real-time
```

#### Batch Processing Best Practices
```bash
# Process papers sequentially (not in parallel)
🦞 You: "Extract methods from these papers one at a time: PMID:123, PMID:456, PMID:789"

# Clear cache between large documents
rm -rf ~/.lobster_workspace/literature_cache/parsed_docs/
```

**Prevention:**
- Parse papers sequentially rather than in parallel
- Docling's retry logic includes explicit `gc.collect()` between attempts
- Cache prevents re-parsing (30-50x faster on subsequent access)
- Consider increasing system RAM for large-scale analysis

### Issue: Methods Section Not Found

**Symptoms:**
```
⚠️  Methods section not found in document
Extracted 0 paragraphs from Methods section
```

**Causes:**
- Non-standard section naming (e.g., "Materials and Methods", "Experimental Procedures")
- Methods split across multiple sections
- PDF parsing failed to detect document structure
- Incompatible PDF format (page-dimensions error)

**Solutions:**

#### Verify Document Structure
```bash
🦞 You: "Show me the document structure and available sections"
🦞 You: "List all section headings found in the paper"
```

#### Try Alternative Keywords
```bash
# Docling searches for these keywords by default:
# "method", "material", "experimental", "procedure", "analysis"
#
# If paper uses non-standard terms, Docling may miss the section

# Check if paper is accessible
🦞 You: "Check if PMID:12345678 is accessible"

# Try extraction with PyPDF2 fallback
# (captures more text but less structured)
```

#### Manual Verification
```bash
# View full PDF text to check section names
🦞 You: "Extract full text from the paper to identify section structure"

# Check if paper has Methods at all
# Some papers (reviews, perspectives) may not have Methods sections
```

#### Check for Incompatible PDFs
```bash
# If you see "page-dimensions" RuntimeError:
# This indicates an incompatible PDF format
# System will automatically fall back to PyPDF2

# Verify fallback behavior
🦞 You: "Extract methods from PMID:12345678"
# Check provenance metadata: {"parser": "pypdf2", "fallback": true}
```

**Quality Metrics:**
- Docling achieves >90% Methods section detection on scientific papers
- PyPDF2 fallback achieves ~30% detection (first 10K chars naive truncation)
- Some papers legitimately don't have Methods sections (reviews, opinions)

### Issue: Page Dimensions RuntimeError

**Symptoms:**
```
RuntimeError: PDF contains page-dimensions errors
Falling back to PyPDF2 after detecting incompatible PDF format
```

**Causes:**
- PDF with malformed page dimension metadata
- Scanned PDFs with inconsistent page sizes
- PDFs created with non-standard tools
- Corrupted PDF files

**Solutions:**

#### Automatic Fallback (No Action Needed)
```bash
# Docling automatically detects this error and falls back to PyPDF2
# Extraction continues with reduced functionality:
# - Methods section still extracted (lower hit rate)
# - Tables won't be extracted
# - Formulas won't be detected
# - Provenance will show: {"parser": "pypdf2", "fallback": true}
```

#### Verify Fallback Success
```bash
🦞 You: "Extract methods from PMID:12345678"
# Check response for "Extraction completed using PyPDF2 fallback"

# Verify provenance metadata
🦞 You: "Show extraction provenance for the last paper"
# Should show: {"parser": "pypdf2", "fallback": true, "fallback_reason": "page-dimensions"}
```

#### PDF Repair (Advanced)
```bash
# Attempt to repair PDF with external tools
# Only if PyPDF2 fallback also fails

# Option 1: Ghostscript repair
gs -o repaired.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress original.pdf

# Option 2: qpdf repair
qpdf --linearize original.pdf repaired.pdf

# Then try extraction again
🦞 You: "Extract methods from repaired.pdf"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- System tries Docling first (max_retries=2 with memory management)
- If RuntimeError with "page-dimensions", immediately falls back to PyPDF2
- PyPDF2 extraction succeeds for most papers (~95% success rate)
- Fallback is logged in provenance for transparency

### Issue: Cache Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Unexpected cache hits for different papers
- Stale cache returning outdated extractions
- Cache consuming excessive disk space
- "Cache read failed" warnings

**Causes:**
- MD5 hash collisions (extremely rare)
- Manual cache modifications
- Corrupted cache files
- Cache directory permissions

**Solutions:**

#### Clear Cache
```bash
# Remove all cached documents
rm -rf ~/.lobster_workspace/literature_cache/parsed_docs/

# Clear specific paper cache
# Cache files named by MD5 hash of source URL
# Example: parsed_docs/abc123def456.json
```

#### Verify Cache Location
```bash
# Check cache directory exists and is writable
ls -la ~/.lobster_workspace/literature_cache/parsed_docs/

# Check cache file sizes
du -sh ~/.lobster_workspace/literature_cache/
# Typical: 500KB-2MB per paper
```

#### Monitor Cache Performance
```bash
# Cache hit: <100ms
# Cache miss (first parse): 2-5 seconds

# You'll see timing in responses:
# "Extraction completed in 0.08s (cached)" - Cache hit
# "Extraction completed in 3.2s" - Fresh parse
```

#### Cache Management Best Practices
```bash
# Cache is persistent across sessions (good for reproducibility)
# Automatic cache invalidation not implemented
# Manual cleanup recommended if:
# - Papers are updated/corrected by publishers
# - Testing different extraction parameters
# - Cache directory exceeds 1GB

# Selective cache cleanup
cd ~/.lobster_workspace/literature_cache/parsed_docs/
# Delete specific paper cache by finding its MD5 hash
```

**Cache Behavior:**
- Cache key: MD5 hash of source URL
- Storage format: JSON (Pydantic serialization)
- Non-fatal failures: Extraction continues if cache read/write fails
- Performance: 30-50x faster on cache hit

### Performance Optimization

#### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process 2-5 papers at a time (not more)
🦞 You: "Extract methods from PMID:123, PMID:456, PMID:789"

# System processes sequentially to avoid memory issues
# Wait for batch completion before starting next batch
```

#### Memory Management
```bash
# Docling's built-in retry logic:
# 1. First attempt: Parse with Docling
# 2. MemoryError → gc.collect() → Retry
# 3. Second MemoryError → Fall back to PyPDF2
# 4. RuntimeError (page-dimensions) → Immediate PyPDF2 fallback

# You don't need to manage retries manually
```

#### Troubleshooting Checklist

When extraction fails, check:
1. ✅ Docling installed: `pip list | grep docling`
2. ✅ Available memory: `free -h` (need >2GB free)
3. ✅ Paper accessibility: `🦞 "Check if PMID:12345 is accessible"`
4. ✅ Cache corruption: Clear cache and retry
5. ✅ Provenance metadata: Check for fallback indicators
